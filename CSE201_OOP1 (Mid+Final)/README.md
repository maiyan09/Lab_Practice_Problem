University Java Exam Solutions
==============================

This folder contains my solved Java programming questions from university midterm and final exams. Each file is named according to a specific pattern for easy identification of the class, semester, and question number.

Naming Convention
-----------------

Each .java file follows the format:

    ClassNameSemesterYear_QuestionNumber

Example:

    CalendarDateFall24_2a.java

Explanation:

- CalendarDate  : The name or topic of the Java class.
- Fall24        : The semester and year (e.g., Fall 2024).
- _2a           : The exam question number (e.g., Question 2, part a).

Purpose
-------

- To organize my Java exam solutions in one place.
- To use as a personal study and revision resource.
- To help others understand how to approach Java exam problems.

Topics Covered
--------------

These solutions may include topics such as:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- File Handling
- Exception Handling

Note
----

These are personal solutions based on real exam questions. Please do not copy blindly â€” understand the code and write your own when studying or practicing.
